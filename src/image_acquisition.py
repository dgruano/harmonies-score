    Image Capture Guidelines:
    1. Ensure the game board is placed on a flat, non-reflective surface.
    2. Use a high-resolution camera for better image quality.
    3. Maintain a consistent distance between the camera and the game board.
    4. Avoid using digital zoom; instead, physically move the camera closer if needed.
    5. Capture images in a well-lit environment to avoid shadows and reflections.
    6. Use natural light or diffuse artificial light to minimize glare.
    7. Ensure the entire game board is within the frame of the image.
    8. Capture images from a top-down perspective, perpendicular to the game board.
    9. Avoid tilting the camera to prevent perspective distortion.
    10. Take multiple images from different angles if necessary.

    Lighting Recommendations:
    1. Use natural light whenever possible.
    2. If using artificial light, use soft, diffuse lighting to avoid harsh shadows.
    3. Position the light source to minimize reflections on the game board.
    4. Avoid direct overhead lighting that can cause glare.
    5. Use multiple light sources from different angles to ensure even lighting.
    6. Test the lighting setup by capturing a few test images and adjusting as needed.

    Background Recommendations:
    1. Use a plain, non-reflective background to avoid distractions.
    2. Choose a background color that contrasts with the game pieces for better visibility.
    3. Ensure the background is free from clutter and other objects.
    4. Avoid using patterned or textured backgrounds that can interfere with image processing.

    Camera Angle Recommendations:
    1. Capture images from a top-down perspective, perpendicular to the game board.
    2. Avoid tilting the camera to prevent perspective distortion.
    3. If capturing images from different angles, ensure the game board remains in the same position.
    4. Use a tripod or stable surface to keep the camera steady.
    5. Take multiple images from different angles if necessary to capture all details.
